This repository contains the code necessary to recreate the data in the dissertation "Finite-Time Control Strategies for Rendezvous and Proximity Operations".

The control approaches studied in the dissertation are divided up into individual folders.
The scripts that generate data generally create simple plots while the plots found in the dissertation are generated by dedicated plotting scripts, indicated by the "plot" portion of the script name.

All data is automatically saved to the control law's "data" folder.
Due to file size constraints, the data for the plots used in the dissertation are not included in this repo but can be obtained via the USU Digital Commons (https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/all_datasets/233/)
Data for the timestep analysis is not saved and is only plotted when generated.

Each control approach has its own subfolder of utility functions.
These consist of the actual implementations of the control laws and functions for simulating the dynamics.
In general, the simulation functions are consistent across all the control laws but some modifications have been made to better integrate with control laws although the dynamics are the same.

The Common Lyapunov Code uses the SDPT3 solver (https://github.com/sqlp/sdpt3).
