This repository contains the code necessary to recreate the data in my dissertation with the code divided by control approaches.

The scripts that generate data generally create simple plots while the plots found in the dissertation are generated by dedicated plotting scripts, indicated by the "plot" portion of the script name.

Data for the actual simulations is included for all control approaches.
Data for other analyses is not included but can be generated and plotted using the appropriate scripts.
All data is automatically saved to the control law's "data" folder.


Each control approach has its own subfolder of utility functions.
These consist of the actual implementations of the control laws and functions for simulating the dynamics.
In general, the simulation functions are consistent across all the control laws but some modifications have been made to better integrate with control laws although the dynamics are the same.

The Common Lyapunov Code uses the SDPT3 solver (https://github.com/sqlp/sdpt3).
